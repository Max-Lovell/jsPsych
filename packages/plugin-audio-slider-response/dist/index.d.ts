/**
 * This plugin plays an audio file and allows the participant to respond by dragging a slider.
 *
 * If the browser supports it, audio files are played using the WebAudio API. This allows for reasonably precise timing of the
 * playback. The timing of responses generated is measured against the WebAudio specific clock, improving the measurement of
 * response times. If the browser does not support the WebAudio API, then the audio file is played with HTML5 audio.
 *
 * Audio files can be automatically preloaded by jsPsych using the [`preload` plugin](preload.md). However, if you are using
 * timeline variables or another dynamic method to specify the audio stimulus, then you will need
 * to [manually preload](../overview/media-preloading.md#manual-preloading) the audio.
 *
 * The trial can end when the participant responds, or if the participant has failed to respond within a fixed length of time. You can also prevent the slider response from being made before the audio has finished playing.
