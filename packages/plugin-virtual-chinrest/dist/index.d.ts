/**
 *
 * This plugin provides a "virtual chinrest" that can measure the distance between the participant and the screen. It
 * can also standardize the jsPsych page content to a known physical dimension (e.g., ensuring that a 200px wide stimulus
 * is 2.2cm wide on the participant's monitor). This is based on the work of [Li, Joo, Yeatman, and Reinecke
 * (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-57204-1), and the plugin code is a modified version of
 * [their implementation](https://github.com/QishengLi/virtual_chinrest). We recommend citing their work in any paper
 * that makes use of this plugin.
 *
 * !!! note "Citation"
 *     Li, Q., Joo, S. J., Yeatman, J. D., & Reinecke, K. (2020). Controlling for Participants’ Viewing Distance in Large-Scale, Psychophysical Online Experiments Using a Virtual Chinrest. _Scientific Reports, 10_(1), 1-11. doi: [10.1038/s41598-019-57204-1](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-57204-1)
 *
 * The plugin works in two phases.
 *
 * **Phase 1**. To calculate the pixel-to-cm conversion rate for a participant’s display, participants are asked to place
 * a credit card or other item of the same size on the screen and resize an image until it is the same size as the credit
 * card. Since we know the physical dimensions of the card, we can find the conversion rate for the participant's display.
 *
 * **Phase 2**. To measure the participant's viewing distance from their screen we use a [blind spot](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_spot_(vision)>) task. Participants are asked to focus on a black square on the screen with their right eye closed, while a red dot repeatedly sweeps from right to left. They press the spacebar on their keyboard whenever they perceive that the red dot has disappeared. This part allows the plugin to use the distance between the black square and the red dot when it disappears from eyesight to estimate how far the participant is from the monitor. This estimation assumes that the blind spot is located at 13.5° temporally.
