/**
 *
 * This plugin displays HTML content and records video from the participant via a webcam.
 *
 * In order to get access to the camera, you need to use the [initialize-camera plugin](initialize-camera.md) on your timeline prior to using this plugin.
 * Once access is granted for an experiment you do not need to get permission again.
 *
 * This plugin records video data in [base 64 format](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Base64).
 * This is a text-based representation of the video which can be coverted to various video formats using a variety of [online tools](https://www.google.com/search?q=base64+video+decoder) as well as in languages like python and R.
 *
 * **This plugin will generate a large amount of data, and you will need to be careful about how you handle this data.**
 * Even a few seconds of video recording will add 10s of kB to jsPsych's data.
 * Multiply this by a handful (or more) of trials, and the data objects will quickly get large.
 * If you need to record a lot of video, either many trials worth or just a few trials with longer responses, we recommend that you save the data to your server immediately after the trial and delete the data in jsPsych's data object.
 * See below for an example of how to do this.
 *
 * This plugin also provides the option to store the recorded video files as [Object URLs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/createObjectURL) via `save_video_url: true`.
 * This will generate a URL that stores a copy of the recorded video, which can be used for subsequent playback during the experiment.
 * See below for an example where the recorded video is used as the stimulus in a subsequent trial.
 * This feature is turned off by default because it uses a relatively large amount of memory compared to most jsPsych features.
 * If you are running an experiment where you need this feature and you are recording lots of video clips, you may want to manually revoke the URLs when you no longer need them using [`URL.revokeObjectURL(objectURL)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/revokeObjectURL).
 *
 * !!! warning
 *     When recording from a camera your experiment will need to be running over `https://` protocol.
 * If you try to run the experiment locally using the `file://` protocol or over `http://` protocol you will not
 * be able to access the camera because of
 * [potential security problems](https://blog.mozilla.org/webrtc/camera-microphone-require-https-in-firefox-68/).
