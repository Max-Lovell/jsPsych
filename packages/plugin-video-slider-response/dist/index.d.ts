 * until a response is given, or for a pre-determined amount of time. The trial can be ended automatically when the
 * participant responds, when the video file has finished playing, or if the participant has failed to respond within
 * a fixed length of time. You can also prevent the slider response from being made before the video has finished playing.
 *
 * Video files can be automatically preloaded by jsPsych using the [`preload` plugin](preload.md). However, if you are
 * using timeline variables or another dynamic method to specify the video stimulus, you will need to
 * [manually preload](../overview/media-preloading.md#manual-preloading) the videos. Also note that video preloading
 * is disabled when the experiment is running as a file (i.e. opened directly in the browser, rather than through a
 * server), in order to prevent CORS errors - see the section on [Running Experiments](../overview/running-experiments.md) for more information.
