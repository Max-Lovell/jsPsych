/**
 * This plugin displays HTML content and records audio from the participant via a microphone.
 *
 * In order to get access to the microphone, you need to use the [initialize-microphone plugin](initialize-microphone.md) on your timeline prior to using this plugin.
 * Once access is granted for an experiment you do not need to get permission again.
 *
 * This plugin records audio data in [base 64 format](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Base64).
 * This is a text-based representation of the audio which can be coverted to various audio formats using a variety of [online tools](https://www.google.com/search?q=base64+audio+decoder) as well as in languages like python and R.
 *
 * **This plugin will generate a large amount of data, and you will need to be careful about how you handle this data.**
 * Even a few seconds of audio recording will add 10s of kB to jsPsych's data.
 * Multiply this by a handful (or more) of trials, and the data objects will quickly get large.
 * If you need to record a lot of audio, either many trials worth or just a few trials with longer responses, we recommend that you save the data to your server immediately after the trial and delete the data in jsPsych's data object.
 * See below for an example of how to do this.
 *
 * This plugin also provides the option to store the recorded audio files as [Object URLs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/createObjectURL) via `save_audio_url: true`.
 * This will generate a URL that is storing a copy of the recorded audio, which can be used for subsequent playback.
 * See below for an example where the recorded audio is used as the stimulus in a subsequent trial.
 * This feature is turned off by default because it uses a relatively large amount of memory compared to most jsPsych features.
 * If you are running an experiment where you need this feature and you are recording lots of audio snippets, you may want to manually revoke the URLs when you no longer need them using [`URL.revokeObjectURL(objectURL)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/revokeObjectURL).
 *
 * !!! warning
 *     When recording from a microphone your experiment will need to be running over `https://` protocol. If you try to run the experiment locally using the `file://` protocol or over `http://` protocol you will not be able to access the microphone because of [potential security problems](https://blog.mozilla.org/webrtc/camera-microphone-require-https-in-firefox-68/).
