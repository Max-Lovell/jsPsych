 * This plugin can be used to draw a stimulus on a [HTML canvas element](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_canvas.asp) and collect a response within a range of values, which is made by dragging a slider. The canvas stimulus can be useful for displaying dynamic, parametrically-defined graphics, and for controlling the positioning of multiple graphical elements (shapes, text, images). The stimulus can be displayed until a response is given, or for a pre-determined amount of time. The trial can be ended automatically if the participant has failed to respond within a fixed length of time.
