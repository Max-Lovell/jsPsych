 * The free-sort plugin displays one or more images on the screen that the participant can interact with by clicking and dragging with a mouse, or touching and dragging with a touchscreen device.

All of the moves that the participant performs are recorded, as well as the final positions of all images. This plugin could be useful when asking participants to position images based on similarity to one another, or to recall image spatial locations.
